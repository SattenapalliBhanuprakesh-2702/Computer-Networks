# Computer Networks for Cybersecurity

This repository is a complete, structured learning path for understanding how computer networks work, how they are attacked, and how they are secured.  
It is designed for students, cybersecurity beginners, and future security engineers who want real, practical networking knowledge instead of fragmented tutorials.

The roadmap takes you from absolute networking fundamentals to enterprise, cloud, and Zero Trust security, using a clear layer‑by‑layer progression.

## What this repository covers

This repository is organized to match how networks exist in the real world and how attackers and defenders interact with them.

You will learn:

- What a network is and why it exists  
- How computers, switches, routers, cables, and access points work  
- How data moves through a network using packets and protocols  
- How the OSI and TCP/IP models structure all communication  
- How IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and NAT control traffic  
- How TCP, UDP, and ports create sessions between systems  
- How DNS, DHCP, ICMP, and other core protocols keep the internet running  
- How web, email, and secure communication actually work  
- How enterprise networks use Active Directory, DNS, and authentication  
- How real networks are designed using firewalls, DMZs, VPNs, and segmentation  
- How traffic is captured and analyzed using Wireshark and PCAP files  
- How attackers exploit networks using MITM, spoofing, scanning, and DoS  
- How defenders stop attacks using monitoring, filtering, and Zero Trust  
- How modern cloud networks (AWS, Kubernetes, VPCs) are built and secured

## Learning Path

The repository is divided into progressive stages:

1. **Network Foundations**  
   Core concepts like networks, internet, LAN, WAN, and how connectivity works.

2. **Components and Topologies**  
   Physical and logical building blocks such as switches, routers, cables, and network layouts.

3. **Data Movement and Models**  
   Packets, encapsulation, OSI model, and TCP/IP model.

4. **Core Networking**  
   IP addressing, subnetting, routing, NAT, TCP, UDP, and ports.

5. **Internet Protocols and Applications**  
   DNS, DHCP, HTTP, HTTPS, TLS, SSH, and how real data moves.

6. **Enterprise and Architecture**  
   Active Directory, Kerberos, DNS in enterprises, firewalls, DMZs, and segmentation.

7. **Traffic Analysis and Monitoring**  
   Packet capture, Wireshark, malware traffic, and intrusion detection.

8. **Attacks and Defense**  
   How networks are attacked and how they are protected.

9. **Cloud and Zero Trust**  
   AWS VPCs, security groups, Kubernetes networking, Zero Trust, and SASE.

10. **Hands‑On Labs**  
    Real exercises to practice subnetting, packet analysis, MITM, DNS attacks, and firewall hardening.
