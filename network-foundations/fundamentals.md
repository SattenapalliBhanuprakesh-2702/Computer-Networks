1. what-is-a-network.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Understand the definition of a computer network and why devices communicate.
   - Content:
     • Define a network: a set of interconnected devices (computers, servers, IoT devices) that exchange data.
     • Key components: nodes (devices), links (connections), endpoints.
     • Types of network traffic: unicast, multicast, broadcast.
     • Example scenarios: home network, office network, internet backbone.
     • Cybersecurity context: understanding networks helps identify potential attack surfaces.

2. why-networks-exist.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Learn the purpose, advantages, and real-world value of networks.
   - Content:
     • Resource sharing: printers, storage, databases, cloud applications.
     • Communication: email, VoIP, messaging, video conferencing.
     • Collaboration: multiple users working on shared resources in real-time.
     • Efficiency: reduces redundancy, centralized management, cost savings.
     • Security relevance: centralized resources create critical points that need protection.
     • Real-world examples: corporate LANs, school networks, ISP networks.

3. types-of-networks-lan-wan-man.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Understand the classification of networks based on geographic scope and scale.
   - Content:
     • LAN (Local Area Network): small area, high speed, controlled environment.
     • WAN (Wide Area Network): spans cities/countries, slower speeds, uses ISPs.
     • MAN (Metropolitan Area Network): city-level, connects multiple LANs.
     • PAN (Personal Area Network): personal devices (smartphones, wearables).
     • Differences in speed, scalability, and cost.
     • Diagrams showing device interconnections for each type.
     • Security relevance: different network types have different attack surfaces.

4. internet-vs-intranet.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Differentiate between public and private networks and their use cases.
   - Content:
     • Internet: public, global, open access, uses public IP addresses.
     • Intranet: private, restricted, controlled by organization, uses private IPs.
     • Access control and authentication methods.
     • Typical use cases: online banking, corporate portals, internal communications.
     • Security considerations: encryption, firewalls, access policies.

5. public-vs-private-networks.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Learn the distinction between public and private network accessibility.
   - Content:
     • Public networks: open access, often insecure (cafes, airports, shared Wi-Fi).
     • Private networks: restricted access, managed internally, secure (home LAN, enterprise networks).
     • IP addressing differences: public IPs vs private IPs (RFC1918).
     • Benefits of private networks: isolation, control, better security.
     • Best practices when connecting to public networks: VPNs, encryption, avoiding sensitive transactions.

6. how-the-internet-works.md
   Description:
   - Learning Objective: Understand the high-level mechanics of the Internet.
   - Content:
     • Data journey: how packets travel from client to server and back.
     • Components: ISPs, routers, switches, servers, DNS servers.
     • Protocol overview: TCP/IP stack, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS.
     • Client-server model explained step-by-step: browser request → DNS resolution → server response.
     • Optional concepts: latency, bandwidth, routing paths.
     • Security relevance: knowing Internet mechanics is critical for understanding attacks like DNS spoofing, MITM, and packet sniffing.
