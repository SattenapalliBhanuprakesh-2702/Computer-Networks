1. what-is-a-network

   Description:
   This file explains the fundamental concept of a computer network. It defines a network as a collection of devices connected together to exchange data and resources. Covers key terminology including nodes (devices such as computers and servers), links (physical or wireless connections), clients, and servers. Explains how networks enable communication and collaboration in daily life, such as messaging, file sharing, and cloud access. Provides simple examples of small networks (home LAN), medium networks (office LAN/WAN), and large-scale networks (corporate WAN or the Internet). Highlights why understanding networks is critical for cybersecurity, as all attacks exploit the underlying network structure.

2. why-networks-exist

   Description:
   This file describes the purpose and benefits of networks. Explains how networks allow resource sharing (printers, storage, software), facilitate communication (email, VoIP, video conferencing), enable data accessibility (files and databases across multiple devices), and improve collaboration among users or teams. Highlights operational efficiency benefits such as cost reduction, central management, and scalability. Uses real-world examples including corporate office networks, educational networks, and ISP infrastructures. Emphasizes the security perspective: centralized resources and communication channels create potential attack surfaces that must be understood and protected.

3. types-of-networks-lan-wan-man

   Description:
   This file explores the main types of networks and their scope. LAN (Local Area Network) is explained as a small, high-speed network in homes or offices, with limited geographical coverage. WAN (Wide Area Network) spans cities, countries, or continents, connects multiple LANs, and relies on ISPs. MAN (Metropolitan Area Network) covers a city or campus, providing faster connectivity than WANs and connecting several LANs. Optionally mentions PAN (Personal Area Network) for devices like smartphones, tablets, and IoT. Includes discussion of their differences in speed, coverage, and purpose. Provides diagrams or examples to illustrate device connections in each type. Highlights security considerations and attack surfaces specific to each network type.

4. internet-vs-intranet

   Description:
   Compares and contrasts the Internet and intranets. Explains the Internet as a public, global network accessible by anyone, using public IPs and often managed by ISPs. Intranets are private networks restricted to organizations, using private IPs, authentication mechanisms, and secure protocols. Covers access control, data privacy, and common use cases like corporate employee portals, internal applications, and online banking systems. Explains why understanding the distinction is critical for cybersecurity, such as securing private networks while safely interacting with public networks.

5. public-vs-private-networks
   Description:
   Details the differences between public and private networks. Public networks are open and accessible to anyone, often less secure (e.g., cafes, airports, or shared Wi-Fi). Private networks are restricted, managed by an organization or individual, and provide a controlled environment (e.g., home LAN, corporate networks). Explains IP addressing differences (public vs private, RFC1918 standards), network isolation, and the importance of security controls in private networks. Provides practical security tips for users connecting to public networks, such as using VPNs, encryption, and avoiding sensitive transactions on insecure connections.

6. how-the-internet-works

   Description:
   Provides a high-level, detailed overview of the Internet’s functionality. Explains how data travels from a client device to a server and back, including the roles of ISPs, routers, switches, and DNS servers. Introduces core concepts like packets, IP addresses, ports, and the TCP/IP protocol stack. Explains client-server interactions step-by-step: browser request, DNS resolution, server response, and packet delivery. Optionally discusses latency, bandwidth, routing paths, and the importance of redundancy. Highlights security relevance, including how this knowledge underpins understanding of attacks like DNS spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and packet sniffing.
